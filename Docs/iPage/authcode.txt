Hi Bob,


I have your domain name unlocked. The auth code is: 559XHt>8PWC6


Your free to begin the transfer at any time now. The admin email is set to: tammie@macombprinter.com


Will she be able to check the email and approve the transfers or should I change it to a different email?


Did you want me to change the name servers like they have indicated below or did you want to wait and change them yourself once the domain has transferred over to your own registrar?


Thanks!!
