              a dangerous situation. Boaters pulling skiiers or tubers should remember that they 
              should be at least 100 feet from shore and other boats. We don't want anyone getting hurt.

            As stated in the Little Swan Lake Club (LSL) Covenants, it is the responsibility of the Little Swan Lake Member to make sure that guests are aware of and abide by all the rules and regulations of Little Swan Lake as well as state and local laws and regulations. The LSL rules are posted on our web site http://littleswanlake.net. Below are a few requirements of special note for guests to use the LSL facilities, including the lake. Most of these are listed also in the various specific sections with more detail, but are gathered here for convenience. 
              <ol>
                <li>■ Clubhouse: the LSL member reserving the clubhouse must be present during the event.</li>
                <li>■ Fishing: a LSL member must be present when a guest is fishing either in a boat or on the shoreline, unless the shoreline is the member’s property. The fisher must be properly licensed by the State of Illinois in all cases.</li>
                <li>■ Boating: a LSL member must be present at the lake when a guest is using the member’s motorized boat. No guest boats are allowed. </li>
                <li>■ Other sport use: a LSL member must accompany the guest when snowmobiles, 4-wheelers etc. are used on any LSL property, including the lake. No vehicles are allowed on the dam without express permission of the LSL board.</li>
                <li>■ Swimming: It is fine for guests to swim no further than 100 feet from shore off a member’s property with no member present. There is no swimming off boats in the Wake Zone or off outlots. When swimming off a member’s boat in the no-wake zone a member must be present at the lake.</li>

          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Tubing or Skiing</strong> - There is a new law which requires a flag flying at the highest part of your boat while pulling tubers
             or skiers or when they are in the water. While skiing or tubing, be sure to have a responsible spotter, 
             the driver <strong>cannot</strong> be considered a spotter. Boat in a counter-clock-wise pattern. 
             Children under 13  must wear life preservers. Lights must be used after dark and boats are restricted to a no-wake speed after dark.
              <br />
              <span class="style1"> (added 8/4/2020)</span>
              <ol>
                <li>■ Two persons are required to be aboard a boat when engaged in towing any person participating in a water sport. 
                      (Sec. 15, Illinois Regulations)</li>
                <li>■ Ski boat operators are advised not to trail tow ropes in the water except when returning for a fallen skier. 
                      Other boaters are cautioned against crossing the ski boat’s wake closer than 100 feet to the boat. 
                      Each boat operator is responsible for his/her own dropped loose skis.</li>
                <li>■ Allow up to 2 tow ropes and a maximum of up to 3 persons in any combination of up to 2 towables built to accompany such.</li>
                <li>■ Children 13 years old and under must wear a life jacket when in a boat that is not tied to a dock.</li>
                <li>■ Boat traffic shall be in counter-clockwise pattern.</li>
                <li>■ State law places restrictions on motorboat operators between the ages of 12 and 17. Such persons must operate the 
                      boat under the supervision of a parent, guardian or someone at least 18 years old that has been designated by a parent, 
                      or must hold a Boating Certificate issued by the State Department of Natural Resources. Such certificates can be earned 
                      by taking an 8 hour boating safety course approved by the department, and offered by organizations, school systems 
                      and volunteers throughout the state. The new law also bars anyone age 9 or under from operating a motorboat, 
                      and requires anyone at 10 or 11 to have a parent, guardian or someone over age 18 aboard.</li>
              </ol>
              </p>
            <p><span class="style3">Boat  Ramp Parking</span> – Please be sure boat trailers are parked at the ramp area rather  that at the Clubhouse. The Clubhouse is often reserved for other functions and  the parking spaces are needed. One or two trailers can take up a lot of parking  spots. We realize at times additional trailer parking could be used and we are  considering options in the Long Range Planning Committee. Anyone interested in  working on the project, please contact a Board Member. </p>
